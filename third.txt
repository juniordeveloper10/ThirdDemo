Solidity was proposed in August 2014 by Gavin Wood;
 the language was later developed by the Ethereum project's Solidity team, led by Christian Reitwiessner. 
Solidity is the primary language on Ethereum as well as on other private blockchains,
 such as the enterprise-oriented Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
